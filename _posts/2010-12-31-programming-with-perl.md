So recently I had to figure out a way to quickly solve a problem involving 6GB of tab delimited text files. I have Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems at my disposal, and therefore have a plethora of "almost" solutions. I spent some time playing with the OS X/Linux tools <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/gawk/gawk.html#Getting-Started">awk</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#Introduction">sed</a>, but couldn't get them to do exactly what I wanted. Surprisingly, I've never used Perl for any real length of time, but I started looking into how I could use Perl to quickly process text files at the command line. It seems like Perl was basically designed with text processing in mind. After a bit of time hacking away at my first Perl script I realized that Perl is awesome! It is one of the most flexible programming languages I've ever used. Perl is available by default on just about every Unix/Linux/OS X system and you can do just about anything with it (including GUI applications). You can also find ton of examples, modules, and other source code over at <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN.org</a>. I've decided to share an example of how to process tab delimited text files under the new <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/projects/perl/perl-scripts/">Perl Scripts section</a> of the website. As I play around more and more with Perl I'll be posting new scripts and projects.
