Now here is a really informative video regarding pointers. Pointers can be extremely confusing for new Computer Science students. I haven't had a chance yet to watch the video in its entirety, but so far it seems like a good watch. Here is a copy of the summary text describing the video:

"<em>Review of pointers and indirect addressing. pass by reference/pass by value. Passing arrays into functions.
3 neat things you can do with pointers:
1. pass by ref
2. dynamic data structures (to come)
3. ADTs in c (to come)
the exponential growth of doubling revisited.
magic trick where you are offered a choice - VS the importance of a good spec.

<strong>*Edit*</strong> 2010-11-26 - I wanted to add an additional alternative resource for learning more about pointers. I've read over must of this tutorial and have found it to be pretty good if you are familiar with C programming. <a href="http://home.netcom.com/~tjensen/ptr/pointers.htm">[HTML] A Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in C (2000 Ted Jensen)</a>
