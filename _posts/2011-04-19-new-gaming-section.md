I've decided to expand upon the original premise of Shwuzzle and include additional topics of interest... most of it will probably be mostly useless ramblings about things that I enjoy. The first of these things is Video Games! I've added a new section just for this topic. Lately I've been really into some of the older CRPGs and find it hard to obtain useful information on the internet. I figured that I could maybe aggregate and share some of the information that I come across. Head over the the<a href="http://www.shwuzzle.com/gaming"> Gaming section</a> of the site to check out some of the things I've added so far. You may want to check back regularly as I will be adding content periodically/randomly as I come across interesting and useful things.
