Someone (Mike Davey) has built an actual, WORKING, <a href="http://www.aturingmachine.com/">Turing Machine</a>. It is complete with a control, a write head, erase head, read head, and even a mechanism for storage using 35mm leader tape (stores about 10 kilobits). His website, <a href="http://www.aturingmachine.com/">aturingmachine.com</a>, has a video where you can watch it working!
