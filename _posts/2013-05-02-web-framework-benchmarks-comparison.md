"<em>How much does your framework choice affect performance? This site helps answer that question.</em>

<em>We've compared the performance of baseline functionality in a variety of web application frameworks, each operating in a realistic production configuration. Results are captured on Amazon EC2 and on physical hardware. The project is still evolving, and as it does so, the Github repository for the project is turning into a showcase of sorts for each framework's best-practices.</em>"
