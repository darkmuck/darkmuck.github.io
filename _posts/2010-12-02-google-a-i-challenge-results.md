Well it looks like the Google A.I. Challenge is finally complete and the final results are now posted! This post is a follow up to my previous post announcing the contest, <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/2010/09/11/google-a-i-challenge/">Google A.I. Challenge (shwuzzle.com)</a>.

Normally, the top few spots are dominated by languages such as C/C++, but this year the top spot was written in LISP. This is due to the author's innovative algorithm.

I actually started the challenge myself and submitted an initial entry, but hadn't had much time to get very far with it. However, check out some of the other top results here: <a href="http://ai-contest.com/rankings.php"> Google A.I. Challenge - Final Rankings (ai-contest.com)</a>
