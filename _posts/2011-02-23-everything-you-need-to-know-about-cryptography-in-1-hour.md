Here is a great slideshow covering cryptography in great detail. It was shown at the BSDCan 2010 (BSD Conference 2010). It's about 1 hour in length, which is somewhat long for a slideshow, but includes a bunch of really interesting information!

"<em>Cryptography is hard. It usually takes many years of study before it  is possible to make any serious contribution to the field; and even  expert cryptographers often have flaws discovered in their work.</em>

<em>However, merely using cryptography requires far less expertise. In  this talk, I will cover everything most software developers will ever  need to know about cryptography -- starting from the very beginning --  along with (time allowing) some of the reasons behind the  recommendations I provide.</em>

<em>Specific topics covered will include symmetric vs. asymmetric  encryption; symmetric vs. asymmetric signatures; block ciphers; block  cipher modes; key lengths; message authentication codes; hash  algorithms; password handling; padding for asymmetric encryption;  padding for asymmetric signing; Diffie-Hellman groups; and side channel  attacks. Specific attacks will be discussed only to the extent of  mentioning that they exist and explaining how cryptography-using systems  should be designed to thwart them.</em>"
