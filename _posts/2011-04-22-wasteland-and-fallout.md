I've added two new pages to the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/">gaming section</a> of the website! Lately I've been trying to play through these two games again and enjoy as much of the small details as possible. There are so many things that you miss when you play the first time or two. The post-apocalyptic genre of games, movies, books, etc. is just about my favorite! Fallout is especially awesome because of how they infuse the retro-futurism with a post-apocalyptic (post-nuclear war) world.

	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/fallout/ ">Fallout (1997)</a> - A computer role-playing game with a post-apocalyptic setting in the mid-22nd century, featuring an alternate history which deviates some time after World War II, where technology, politics and culture followed a different course.</li>
	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/wasteland/ ">Wasteland (1988)</a> - A post-apocalyptic computer role-playing game, and precursor to the  Fallout series. Itâ€™s set in the middle of the 21st century, following a  nuclear war between the USA and Soviet Union.<strong> </strong></li>
