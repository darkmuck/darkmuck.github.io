Google Blockly is a new visual programming language that is itself written in JavaScript. This means that it can be embedded in any webpage and its code can even be exported to JavaScript, DART, or Python.

It's open source and the code is available here along with a few demos: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/">code.google.com/p/google-blockly</a>.

It seems to be a great tool to get non-programmers to start programming without the need to learn a language.
