Is it a good idea to share your own personal R&amp;D projects, ideas, and efforts freely with the world? Most of my ideas have probably already been done (better?) by someone else in the past, but my "R&amp;D" projects/ideas serve their purpose of helping me learn new things along the way; and I thought what better way to help others learn new things than by sharing? There is a new section, <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/projects/research-and-development/">Research and Development</a>, devoted to these types of projects and ideas. There isn't any content up at the moment, and it will therefore serve as a place holder until I can organize some things to post. However in the meantime, if you have any interesting projects or ideas that you'd like to share please<a href="mailto:shwuzzle@shwuzzle.com"> let me know</a> <a href="mailto:shwuzzle@shwuzzle.com">(shwuzzle@shwuzzle.com)</a>!
