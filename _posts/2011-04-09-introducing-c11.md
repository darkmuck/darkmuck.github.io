So it appears that the next iteration of C++ has officially been dubbed C++11 and has been approved by the technical standards committee. This is the next official iteration of the C++ programming language. The standardization of the language allows it to be used on virtually every machine from every implementation provider. The standardization usually occurs about every 10 years and the original creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, is usually always involved. For more information and a fairly good overview of this new iteration of C++ check out the links below.
