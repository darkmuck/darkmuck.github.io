There are many Computer Science timelines out there that describe the major milestones in the field. Most of these detail things such as the founding of major companies involved in Computer Science. This doesn't necessarily give us a good understanding of the true history of Computer Science and of the major breakthroughs which occurred <em>after</em> (and due to) a company's founding. Check out the link below for a (huge!) timeline of Computer Science.
