I've added two new pages to the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/">gaming section</a>:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/normality/">Normality</a> (1996) - Normality is a 3D graphical adventure game. It was one of the first few games to use exclusively pre-rendered graphics. The story revolves around Kent Knutson, a rebellious teenager in the city of Neutropolis, from which various places take up the setting of the game.</li>
	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/gaming/the-journeyman-project/">The Journeyman Project </a>(1993) - The year is 2318. The place: the sky-born city of Caldoria. After a century of bitter struggle, humanity has finally learned to live in peace.</li>
</ol>
These two games are lesser known adventure titles. Most people probably haven't heard of them, but they are lots of fun if given a chance!
