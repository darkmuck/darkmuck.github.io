I've just officially released my first Android application! It is an <strong>extremely</strong> simple, no-frills deals widget. The Newest Deal lite displays the latest deal in a home screen widget. This app has mainly served as a learning tool to get my hands wet with Android development.However, I do plan on releasing a full non-lite version in the near future with many additional features and the ability to customize the widget.
