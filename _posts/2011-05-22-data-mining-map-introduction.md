If you are new to data mining and want a really good introduction, <a href="http://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/~datamining/dmc/data_mining_map.htm">here</a> is a really good "interactive" tutorial. It's interactive in the sense that it lays everything out on a sort of flow diagram/map. It's really easy to read and there is some really good information here. Check it out here: <a href="http://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/~datamining/dmc/data_mining_map.htm">Data Mining Map (chem-eng.utoronto.ca/~datamining/dmc/data_mining_map.htm)</a>.
