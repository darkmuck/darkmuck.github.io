Lately I've been struggling with really terrible performance on my VirtualBox virtual machines. I've begun to do a bit of research on improving the performance of my VMs and so far the most helpful tip was to switch the VM disk image to SATA instead of IDE. Check out the following link for a detailed set of instructions on how to make this switch: <a href="http://matt.bottrell.com.au/archives/265-Improving-VirtualBox-performance.html">Improving VirtualBox performance (http://matt.bottrell.com.au)</a>.
