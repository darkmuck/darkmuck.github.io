Dart is a new web programming language developed by Google. It is set to be first unveiled at the GOTO conference, which is held between October 10-12, 2011. The primary intent of Dart is to replace JavaScript. The primary goals of Dart are to solve some of JavaScript's problems while providing increased performance and security.
