This is something definitely worth sharing, very useful for anyone who wants to learn more about different sorting algorithms.Â  If you want to learn more about different types of sorting this is the perfect place to start. It even has animations to show how different algorithms work and pseudo-code to help you get started with implementation!

Check out the site here: <a href="http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/">Sorting Algorithm Animations (sorting-algorithms.com)</a>

Here is an example of some of the sorting animations:
