It's (almost) time for the Google A.I. Challenge for 2011 already! Check out the official <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge/wiki">github page</a> for detailed information on the contest, examples, forums, and more. The 2011 Challenge is about ants looking for food on a map and fighting against ants by the opponent. The contest hasn't started quite yet, but you can get a head start on it by reading up at the official github page and maybe getting started early.
