It's been 25 years since C++ was first released by Bjarne Stroustrup. Wired.com has an interview with him discussing the language and his thoughts its creation and impact. C++ is one of the most used and universal programming languages out there. Bjarne comments on the popularity factor by stating that he does not believe that there is a single perfect language for every problem out there. However, in my opinion it is pretty amazing that C++ is available on just about every single hardware/software environment out there. Check out the full article for more interesting commentary from the creator of C++ here: <a href="http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/10/1014cplusplus-released/all/1">Oct. 14, 1985: C++ Adds to Programming</a>.
