First, we should start off by explaining what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing Machine</a> is. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing Machine</a> is a theoretical machine that manipulates symbols on a tape. This machine is simple but easily adaptable. It is able to simulate the logic of any algorithm and is especially useful at explaining how a CPU functions. The machine is named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, who was one of the most significant computer scientists and mathematicians of the early to mid 1900's. He developed this device as a thought experiment with the purpose of representing a computing machine. It wasn't meant to be an actual, practical computing device.

In order for a programming language, instruction set, or similar set of data-manipulation rules to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete">Turing complete</a> it must be able to fully simulate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>. The rules that follow in sequence on data must be able to produce the result of any calculation. At a minimum, to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete">Turing complete</a>, the rules must contain conditional branching and the ability to change memory.

It can be proven that something is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete">Turing complete</a> by showing that the rules can simulate the most primitive computer, because even the simplest computer can simulate the most complicated computer.

This is a very basic answer, but this should provide a good overview to get started learning about what it means to be Turing complete. Check out the resources below for additional information.
