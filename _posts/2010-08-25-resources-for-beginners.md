As a relative newcomer to a Computer Science M.Sc. program I have trying to do a lot of reading and understanding outside of the assigned coursework and information from the university. It seems to be difficult at times to understand and digest some of the information out there. Much of it is really complex and I have found that I need to build a better foundational understanding in certain areas of Computer Science before reading some of the more prominent research papers (and other information).

Although I will add additional information and resources to the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/resources/">resources page</a>, I thought it may be beneficial to add some of them in this post to bring awareness to a bunch of good places to start with "beginner" research.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ch0wt/a_reading_list_for_the_selftaught_computer/">Reading List for the Self-Taught Computer Scientist (via reddit.com)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (via mit.edu)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/">MIT Courseware: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx">Stanford Engineering Everywhere</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/">Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange (ask questions and find answers)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://csunplugged.com/">Computer Science Unplugged</a></li>
</ul>
Also, don't forget that the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/resources/">resources page</a> contains research papers, external links, and other information.
