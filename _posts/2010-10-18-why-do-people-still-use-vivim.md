Starting off learning Vim is easy, but understanding the actual purpose of modal editing can be easily overlooked by most people. Even some of the most dedicated Vi/Vim users overlook the point of modal editing.

Vi, which is about 30 years old, or the more recent 15 year old Vim are two of the most popular and powerful text editors for any platform out there. It is generally understood that they are installed by default on Unix systems, but you can actually run them on just about any operating system (Windows, Mac, BSD, etc.).

Most people will spend most of their time in insert mode; not understanding most of the commands or chains of commands that one can use in Vi/Vim. There are many beneficial commands that can be chained together to really improve your productivity. For example, you can combine things like 'd' (delete) and 'e' (end of word) to form 'de', which is a complete command that will delete to the end of the current word. There are dozens of other powerful commands out there. Another one worth mentioning is the '.' command. This one will repeat the last complete combined editing command. It can help repeat complex tasks involving a chain of commands
