Now here is a good article (mainly for Unix beginners) that outlines some of the most useful basic Unix commands available.Â  Read the article here: <a href="http://kresimirbojcic.com/2011/11/22/unix-command-line-fu.html">Unix Command Line Fu (via kresimirbojcic.com)</a>. The article covers commands such as: cut, grep, sort, uniq, cat, tac, join, tail, head, etc. It also tells you a bit about how to use each one for specific situations.This is by no means a comprehensive list, but there are many useful things here that I definitely didn't know how to do before!
