<ul>
	<li>Binomial Coefficient</li>
	<li>Demorgan's Laws</li>
	<li>Eigenvector and Eigenvalue</li>
	<li>Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages</li>
	<li>Information Entropy</li>
	<li>Bayes' Theorem</li>
	<li>Fermat's Little Theorem</li>
	<li>Natural Join</li>
	<li>The Fixed-Point (Y) Combinator</li>
	<li>O(N)</li>
	<li>Euler's Identity</li>
</ul>
