Although this article appears to be specific for Computer Science majors, much of it overlaps with software engineering. It outlines some extremely useful and interesting things that all Computer Science/Software Engineering majors should know. The four main questions that this article answers are:
<ul>
	<li>What should every student know to get a good job?</li>
	<li>What should every student know to maintain lifelong employment?</li>
	<li>What should every student know to enter graduate school?</li>
	<li>What should every student know to benefit society?</li>
</ul>
Some of the suggestions mention things such as embracing the Unix philosophy, having a portfolio as a resume, having systems administration knowledge, knowing data structures and algorithms, and many other important things.
