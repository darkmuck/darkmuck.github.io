Just a few excellent responses from Stackoverflow.com to the question: "<em>What programming terms have you coined that have taken off in your own circles (i.e. have heard others repeat it)? It might be within your own team, workplace or garnered greater popularity on the Internet."</em> Some examples being: "Yoda Conditions" and "Pokemon Exception Handling."
