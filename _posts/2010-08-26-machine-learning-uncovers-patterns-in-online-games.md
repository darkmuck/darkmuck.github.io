Online games can create a ton of complex data. But it can be a gold mine for design ideas, at least according to the article over at newscientist.com. In this article they talk about data mining online gaming data, with hopes of reaping the rewards of new ideas based on user behavior. The researchers are even using computer controlled bots that learn from the data mined from human behavior in game replays. This can make for much smarter artificial intelligence. In order to conduct their research they are using machine learning algorithms to uncover complex patterns. Check out the article for the full story.
