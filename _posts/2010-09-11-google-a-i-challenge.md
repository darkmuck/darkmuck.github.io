For anyone who is interested, the Google AI Challenge is now available at <a href="http://ai-contest.com/index.php">ai-contest.com</a>. I doubt I will do very well at all, but nonetheless they have some really helpful and interesting tutorials on the website. So if nothing else you will have the chance to learn some really interesting things from the contest. The contest seems really organized and well thought out by the University of Waterloo Computer Science Club. Also, I've actually already downloaded, compiled, and uploaded the C++ starter package, so if nothing else, I'll at least appear on the leaderboards!  They also have starter packages for Java, Python, and C# if you don't prefer C++.

Here is an example visualization of two computer bots duking it out in Planet Wars for the contest:
