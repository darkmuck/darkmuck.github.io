Welcome to the new Shwuzzle.com! The primary focus for Shwuzzle will be to discuss, share, research, and learn more about topics of and relating to Computer Science. I will be continually in the process of updating the website with interesting information and content that I find from external resources and from content that I produce in my free time and academia. For more information on what Shwuzzle is all about, check out the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/about/">about page</a>. Feel free to share any interesting ideas, content, projects, resources, etc. via <a href="mailto:wdistefano@shwuzzle.com">wdistefano@shwuzzle.com</a>!
