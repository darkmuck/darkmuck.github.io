<em>"In the world of enterprise programming, the mainstream is broad and  deep. Code is written predominantly in one of a few major languages. For  some shops, this means Java; for others, it's C# or PHP.  Sometimes, enterprise coders will dabble in C++ or another common  language used for high-performance tasks such as game programming, all  of which turn around and speak SQL to the database. </em>

<em>Programmers  looking for work in enterprise shops would be foolish not to learn the  languages that underlie this paradigm, yet a surprising number of niche  languages are fast beginning to thrive in the enterprise. Look beyond  the mainstays, and you'll find several languages that are beginning to  provide solutions to increasingly common problems, as well as old-guard  niche languages that continue to occupy redoubts. All offer capabilities  compelling enough to justify learning a new way to juggle brackets,  braces, and other punctuation marks.</em>

<em><strong></strong></em>

<em>While  the following seven niche languages offer features that can't be found  in the dominant languages, many rely on the dominant languages to exist.  Some run on top of the Java Virtual Machine, essentially taking  advantage of the Java team's engineering. And when Microsoft built C#,  it explicitly aimed to make the virtual machine open to other languages.  That detail may help make deployment easier, but it doesn't matter much  to the programmer at creation time.</em>

<em>Either way, these seven  languages are quickly gaining converts in the enterprise. Perhaps it's  time to start investigating their merits.</em>"
