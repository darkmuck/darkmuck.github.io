This isn't necessarily Computer Science related, but it is an article which I found interesting nonetheless. Here is an excerpt from the beginning of the article that gives you a good overview of what the entire 4-page article is about:

"<em>Current computer graphics are fairly well known and understood. But  how did we get here? The evolution of computer graphics is intertwined  with textual display, and it is difficult to consider the two  separately.</em>

<em>An old saying has it that a picture is worth a thousand words. The  exact quantification of the value of imagery versus text appears to vary  somewhat with subject matter, and is probably better left to  psychologists and social scientists. But there is little question of the  kernel of truth in the saying, and it has been a driver of computer  architecture for many years.</em>

<em>Computer graphics are taken for granted today. But it has been a long  and painful struggle, with hardware rarely keeping up with the demand  for better images. In English, there are a relatively small number of  characters which comprise text. The same is not true of images: graphics  are computationally intensive. They always seem to take as much speed  and memory as there are available. But the demand was high enough that  early computer graphics could be fairly crude and still be in demand.</em>" (via <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/01/the-evolution-of-computer-displaysthe-evolution-of-computer-displays.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss">arstechnica.com</a>)
