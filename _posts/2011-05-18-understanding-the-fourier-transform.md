"<em>A very long time ago, I was curious how to detect the strength of the  bass and treble in music, in order to synchronize some graphical  effects. I had no idea how to do such a thing, so I tried to figure it  out, but I didn’t get very far. Eventually I learned that I needed  something called a <a title="Fourier transform" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fourier transform</a>, so I took a trip to the library and looked it up (which is what we had to do back in those days).</em>

<em>What I found was the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which looks like this:</em>

<em>This formula, as anyone can see, makes no sense at all. I decided  that Fourier must have been speaking to aliens, because if you gave me  all the time and paper in the world, I would not have been able to come  up with that.</em>

<em>Eventually, I was able to visualize how it works, which was a bit of a  lightbulb for me. That’s what I want to write about today: an intuitive  way to picture the Fourier transform. This may be obvious to you, but  it wasn’t to me, so if you work with audio or rendering, I hope there’s  something here you find useful......</em>" continued at: <a href="http://altdevblogaday.org/2011/05/17/understanding-the-fourier-transform/">Understanding the Fourier transform (altdevblogaday.org)</a>
