Check out this infographic which describes many of the Computer Science pioneers, various facts, algorithms, statistics, and other information. After reviewing it for a few minutes I noticed that it is by no means 'complete', but its really interesting nonetheless. Also, I've linked to a full-size version of the infographic and also a smaller one for easier reading.
