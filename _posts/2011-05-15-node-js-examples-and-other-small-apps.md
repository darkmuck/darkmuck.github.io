I've begun messing around with Node.js in my spare time. I don't really have a normal project idea in mind per se, but I have started to upload some of the examples and other small applications I've been creating. I'm still learning more about the <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js JavaScript event-driven I/O framework</a> and I will continue posting more examples/apps as I go along. It seems like a really interesting concept and this is the first time I've done actual server-side JavaScript development. There is much potential in Node.js; it's become a huge trend in the JavaScript community as of late.
