Today marks the start of development on my first "official" Android application. I plan to release it to the Android Market once its ready to go. The app is called UpDog and it is intended to be a simple status sharing application. With UpDog you can find out what your friends are up to as well as share your own status. It is intended to be a very simple (and free!) application/service. UpDog will serve as more of a learning experience for development on the Android platform. I'll be announcing more information and details in the near future as development progresses!

tldr What's UpDog?
