A multi-core CPU is not always a better performer than a single-core CPU. This fact depends upon many different factors, including the task at hand, the architecture of the CPU, etc. The following article provides a good bit of information on the factors surrounding this fact in detail. Check out the excerpt below or check out the <a href="http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/multi-core-and-multi-threading/">full article here (scalibq.wordpress.com)</a>.

"<em>.... The thing is, time and time again I see people recommending a CPU with more cores for applications that require more threads. As Johan de Gelas points out in the aforementioned article, it is not that simple. Although the Bulldozer-based Opterons have 16 cores, they often have trouble keeping up with the older 12 core Magny Cours-based Opterons.</em>

<em>Now, it seems there is a common misconception. Perhaps it is because the younger generations have grown up with multi-core processors only. At any rate, let me point out the following:</em>

<em>In order to use multiple cores at the same time, multiple threads are required. The inverse is not true!</em>

<em>That is: a single core is not limited to running a single thread. ....</em>"
