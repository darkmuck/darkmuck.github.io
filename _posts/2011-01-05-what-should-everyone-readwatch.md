There are a couple of great posts floating around over at the <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com">Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange</a>. The trend with these topics is "What should everyone read/watch". Some of the users have posted some really useful resources and I thought it would be a great idea to aggregate the posts and share them here:
