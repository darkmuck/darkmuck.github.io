I recently came across a set of really useful assembly tutorial videos. They seem to be primarily 'hacker' oriented, but I thought that there was quite a good bit of content related to assembly programming. The videos include topics on Windows assembly programming, general assembly programming, as well as some hacking-related and exploit-related videos.
