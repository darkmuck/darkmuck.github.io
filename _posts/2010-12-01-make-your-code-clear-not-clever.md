There are many things that we do in our code that makes it harder to understand, read, modify, etc. This article describes many of the common mistakes made by many undergraduate students and new programmers. Most of the code used as examples in the article is written in C, but the mistakes described can apply to just about any common programming language.

"<em>I've read quite a lot of student code over the years. Some of it is quite good. A lot of it is full of predictable badnesses. These notes attempt to enumerate some of this badness, so that you may avoid it....</em>"
