I do quite a bit of Linux/Unix systems administrator on a day-to-day basis. Over time you sort of find out that there are quite a few 'common traits' that apply to your usual set of Unix admins. Some examples: the use of Vi, use of Perl, restrained use of sudo, etc. I found a list over at <a href="http://www.infoworld.com">infoworld.com</a> that describes some of these 'common traits', actually some of them are kind of funny, but there are a few that are most definitely true. Check out the list for your self: <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/unix/nine-traits-the-veteran-unix-admin-276">Nine Traits of the Veteran Unix Admin (infoworld.com)</a>
