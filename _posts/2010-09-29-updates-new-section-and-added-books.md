I'm constantly in search of more software and tools to increase my productivity and also to play around with. I thought I'd share some of my discoveries by posting a new page,<a href="http://shwuzzle.com/resources/software-and-tools/"> Software and Tools</a>, on the website. If there's anything you'd like to contribute send me an email with your ideas!

Also, I've added a couple of new books to the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/resources/books-articles-etc/">Books, Articles, etc.</a> page. I've been searching for good free ebooks on various computer science topics and when I come across them I try to get them up on the site in this section. Most of the books I post on here I've either heard really good things about or I've read myself and found interesting. For example, I've been learning more about Lambda Calculus lately and one book that has helped me get started was the book:<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/lambda.pdf"> Introduction to Lambda Calculus</a>. I try to only post free ebooks, but occasionally I come across really good commercial paperback books that are worthwhile.
