"<em>The Facebook Hacker Cup is an annual Facebook programming competition  where hackers compete against each other for fame, fortune, glory and a  shot at the coveted Hacker Cup. Many will enter... only one will emerge as world champion.</em>"

This seems like a really challenging competition. If I find the time I might participate, mostly for fun! I won't even be close to winning anything, but it will be a nice challenge nonetheless.
