I've just recently created and posted a few things on <a href="https://github.com/darkmuck">my GitHub page (github.com/darkmuck) </a>and one of the projects posted is VIMS (Voyager Incident Management System). VIMS is a simple incident management/help desk web application. I've decided that it might be worthwhile to open source this application as it's been sitting dormant on my machine for quite some time. Feel free to check it out on the <a href="https://github.com/darkmuck/VIMS">VIMS GitHub page</a> and also check out <a href="https://github.com/darkmuck">my profile on GitHub</a> for other projects.

Also, if you want to see what VIMS looks (screenshots!) like or if you want some additional information on the project check out the <a href="http://shwuzzle.com/projects/vims-voyager-incident-management-system/">VIMS project page on Shwuzzle</a>.
