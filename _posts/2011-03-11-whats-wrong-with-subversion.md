SVN (Apache Subversion) has been around for about 11 years now (initial release: October 20, 2000). It was originally meant to be mostly compatible with and a successor to CVS (Concurrent Versions System). It has succeed as such and is one of the most widely used software version control systems in existence.

However, in modern times there are quite a few issues with SVN that may be solved by switching to a different version control system (e.g. GIT, Mercurial, etc.). I came across an interesting article which describes many of the most prevalent issues with using Subversion with modern software development. The article outlines issues such as merging, committing == publishing, and a few others. Check out the link at the end of this post to read the full article.

Lately I've been a huge fan of GIT. It is easy to use, each developer's working copy is basically a private branch, really good usability, and excellent command-line tools. However, Mercurial is another one that I want to try out eventually. It seems to be a slightly less popular alternative to GIT.
