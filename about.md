### About

I am a software architect/developer interested in both front and back end development, especially (but not only) JavaScript (mostly React/Angular/Vue/Node), .NET (C#/VB/ASP/MVC/WebAPI/etc), and SQL. I try to blog on topics related to software engineering as I explore and learn new things. <a href="../williamdistefano_resume.pdf">My resume/CV.</a>

### Education

Master's in Software Engineering from Penn State, Bacherlor's in Information Systems from Penn State and Associate's in Computer Networking from HACC.

### Code

Most of my code is not publicly visible, but I do have a few tiny repositories <a href="https://github.com/darkmuck">here on GitHub</a>. Much of the code may be out of date and/or very incomplete.

### Work

I currently work for Microsoft as an Apps Consultant, and in the past for ComputerAid as a Software Architect, TecPort Solutions, Pennsylvania State University, Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, and PerformCare.
