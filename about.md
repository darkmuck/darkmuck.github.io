### About me

I love to build and to learn things. I'm a senior developer by day and tinkerer by night. I am experienced in C#/VB .NET, ASP.NET, JavaScript/AJAX/jQuery/AngularJS, HTML5/CSS3, TFS/GIT, Bootstrap, and Agile/Waterfall Methodologies.  <a href="williamdistefano_resume.pdf">Click here to view my resume.</a>
