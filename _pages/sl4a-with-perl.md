SL4A (Scripting Layer for Android) provides you with the ability to use scripting languages on your Android device to create applications and scripts. This page is devoted to the research and development of ideas which probably have no real practical use, but are at least interesting to play around with!

To get started with scripting on Android check out the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/">official Android Scripting page on Google Code</a>.

I'll post some sample code, projects, and ideas in the near future. I've been experimenting with the device's various sensors and trying to develop simple prototype scripts for fun.
