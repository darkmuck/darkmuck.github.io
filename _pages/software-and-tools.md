<strong>Meld
</strong>

Meld is a visual diff and merge tool. I've found it to be an indispensable tool for comparing files. It's one of the best diff tools that I've used. The source code is available with instructions for installing on Linux, Unix, BSD, or OS X based machines. For more information visit the<a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/"> Meld's webpage on sourceforge.org</a>.
