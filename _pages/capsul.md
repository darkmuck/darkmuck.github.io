Capsul is a small hybrid JavaScript and PHP framework. Capsul's primary intent is for use in web applications or small websites where lots of AJAX may be used. It is meant to be tiny and fast. The goal is to provide just enough to get started while maintaining a high level of extensibility and flexibility.

Requirements
<ul>
	<li>PHP 5.x</li>
	<li>MySQL 5.x</li>
	<li>JQuery 1.4.x (included)</li>
</ul>
