Shwuzzle was originally intended to serve primarily as a sort of repository for my projects, my research, and various Software Engineering and Computer Science related topics in the form of blog posts, research papers, and other resources.

<strong>About Me</strong>

I've recently finished my graduate degree in Software Engineering, but I am always trying to learn more. I've been writing software since I was in middle school and I'm now working as a software engineer. My experience is mostly in the form of web development, but I've used quite a wide spectrum of tools, frameworks, and libraries. I'm always trying to learn more and spend time learning more about how to engineer better software and researching anything I find interesting.
