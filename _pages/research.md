This page is a home for various research, prototypes, or ideas that I'm working on. Many of these things have probably been done before, but the primary purpose is to help me learn and share my findings. There are quite a few things that I've been thinking about and working on and will post information about soon. However, here are a couple of things that I've documented so far.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/projects/research-and-development/node-js-playground/">Node.js Playground (examples and other small apps)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://shwuzzle.com/projects/research-and-development/sl4a-with-perl/">SL4A with Perl (Scripting Layer for Android)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/darkmuck/algorithms">Algorithm Implementations (github)</a></li>
	<li>PHP Performance Tests (soon)</li>
</ul>
